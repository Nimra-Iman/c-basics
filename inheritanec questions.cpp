### Simple Inheritance Questions:

1. **Basic Inheritance:**
   - Create a base class `Vehicle` with attributes `make` and `model`. Derive a class `Car` from `Vehicle` that adds attributes 
   `num_doors` and `sunroof`.

2. **Animal Example:**
   - Create a class `Animal` with methods `eat()` and `sleep()`. Create a derived class `Bird` that adds a method `fly()`.

3. **Employee Example:**
   - Create a class `Employee` with attributes `name` and `salary`. Derive a class `Manager` from `Employee` 
   that adds an attribute `department`.

### Multiple Inheritance Questions:

1. **Car Example:**
   - Create two base classes `Engine` with an attribute `horsepower` and `Body` with an attribute `color`. Derive a 
   class `Car` that inherits from both `Engine` and `Body` and adds an attribute `num_doors`.

2. **Device Example:**
   - Create two base classes `Screen` with a method `display()`, and `Battery` with a method `charge()`. Derive a class 
   `Smartphone` that inherits from both `Screen` and `Battery`, adding a method `call()`.

3. **Student Example:**
   - Create two base classes `Person` with attributes `name` and `age`, and `Learner` with an attribute `student_id`.
    Derive a class `Student` that inherits from both `Person` and `Learner`, adding an attribute `grade`.
